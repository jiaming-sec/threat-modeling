# Introduction to Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is a proactive security process that helps identify, understand, and mitigate potential security risks within a system. It encourages developers, engineers, and security professionals to think like attackers and design systems with defense in depth from the ground up.

## Why Threat Modeling?

- 🛡️ **Identify vulnerabilities early:** Helps detect security flaws during design, saving time and cost.
- 🔍 **Understand attacker perspectives:** Encourages teams to analyze how their systems could be attacked.
- 🎯 **Prioritize mitigation:** Focuses attention on the most critical and impactful threats.
- 📈 **Improve communication:** Encourages collaboration across development, operations, and security teams.
