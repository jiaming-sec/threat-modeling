# Introduction to Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is a proactive security process that helps identify, understand, and mitigate potential security risks within a system. It encourages developers, engineers, and security professionals to think like attackers and design systems with defense in depth from the ground up.

## Why Threat Modeling?

- 🛡️ **Identify vulnerabilities early:** Helps detect security flaws during design, saving time and cost.
- 🔍 **Understand attacker perspectives:** Encourages teams to analyze how their systems could be attacked.
- 🎯 **Prioritize mitigation:** Focuses attention on the most critical and impactful threats.
- 📈 **Improve communication:** Encourages collaboration across development, operations, and security teams.

## When Should You Perform Threat Modeling?

- During the design of a new system or application
- When significant changes are made to architecture or infrastructure
- Before system deployment or release
- After a security incident for post-mortem analysis

## Who Should Be Involved?

- **Developers** – for understanding code-level concerns
- **Architects** – for system-level visibility
- **Security Engineers** – for identifying threat patterns
- **Product Owners** – for aligning security with business goals
- **Operations/DevOps** – for deployment and infrastructure insight

## Key Concepts

### Assets
Anything valuable that needs protection, such as:
- Customer data
- Application code
- User credentials
- APIs

### Threat Actors
Entities that could exploit vulnerabilities:
- External hackers
- Insider threats
- Competitors
- Automated bots

### Entry Points
Points where data or control enters the system:
- Web forms
- APIs
- Third-party integrations
- Mobile app inputs

## Common Threat Modeling Methodologies

- **STRIDE** – Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
- **DREAD** – Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability
- **PASTA** – Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis
- **LINDDUN** – Focuses on privacy threats
- **Attack Trees** – Visual representation of potential attack paths

## Benefits of Threat Modeling

✅ Reduces risk before deployment  
✅ Improves architecture and code quality  
✅ Supports compliance and regulatory goals (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA)  
✅ Helps build a security-focused engineering culture
