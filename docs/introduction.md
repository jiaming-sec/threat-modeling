# Introduction to Threat Modeling

Threat modeling is a proactive security practice that identifies and mitigates potential security threats and vulnerabilities within a system. It is a critical activity in secure software development and system design, helping teams anticipate potential attack paths and design defenses before threats are realized.

## Why Threat Modeling?
- 🛡️ **Identify vulnerabilities early**: Catch weaknesses before they’re exploited.
- 🧠 **Understand attacker perspectives**: Adopt an adversarial mindset to outsmart threats.
- 🗂️ **Prioritize security investments**: Focus on what matters most.
- 🤝 **Improve team collaboration**: Align security, dev, ops, and product teams.
- 📈 **Meet compliance goals**: Satisfy standards like ISO 27001, SOC 2, HIPAA, etc.
  
## When Should You Perform Threat Modeling?
- During the initial system architecture or design phase
- When adding new features or integrating third-party components
- During infrastructure changes (e.g., cloud migration)
- Post-incident analysis or security audits
  
## Who Should Be Involved?
- **Developers:** Code-level understanding of the system
- **Security Engineers:** Threat intelligence and vulnerability expertise
- **System Architects:** Structural and architectural knowledge
- **Product Managers:** Business requirements and impact
- **Operations Teams:** Deployment and infrastructure details


## Core Concepts

### Assets
Items or components that have value and require protection, such as:
- User credentials and identities
- Business logic
- APIs and endpoints
- Personal identifiable information (PII)
- Cloud configurations

### Threat Actors
Entities that could exploit vulnerabilities:
- External hackers
- Insider threats
- Competitors
- Automated bots

### Attack Vectors
Common entry points used to exploit vulnerabilities:
- Public APIs
- Web interfaces
- Mobile apps
- External storage (e.g., misconfigured S3 buckets)

## Threat Modeling Lifecycle
1. **Define Security Objectives** – Align threat modeling goals with business needs
2. **Decompose the Application/System** – Understand data flows and component interactions
3. **Identify Threats** – Use models like STRIDE or PASTA to uncover threats
4. **Assess Risks** – Score threats using DREAD or custom metrics
5. **Define Mitigations** – Design and implement appropriate controls
6. **Validate and Review** – Ensure accuracy and revisit after changes


### Entry Points
Points where data or control enters the system:
- Web forms
- APIs
- Third-party integrations
- Mobile app inputs

## Common Threat Modeling Methodologies

- **STRIDE** – Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege
- **DREAD** – Damage, Reproducibility, Exploitability, Affected users, Discoverability
- **PASTA** – Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis
- **LINDDUN** – Focuses on privacy threats
- **Attack Trees** – Visual representation of potential attack paths

## Benefits of Threat Modeling

✅ Reduces risk before deployment  
✅ Improves architecture and code quality  
✅ Supports compliance and regulatory goals (e.g., SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA)  
✅ Helps build a security-focused engineering culture

## How to Get Started

1. Define the system and its boundaries
2. Identify assets and entry points
3. Enumerate threats using a model like STRIDE
4. Score threats (e.g., with DREAD)
5. Define mitigation strategies
6. Review regularly as the system evolves
